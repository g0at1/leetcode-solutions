## About

LeetCode is a platform that provides a collection of coding challenges that can help you improve your algorithmic and coding skills. In this repository, you'll find my solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems. Each solution is accompanied by a detailed explanation of the approach I took and the reasoning behind it.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions in this repository. You can clone the repository locally and navigate through the folders to find solutions to specific LeetCode problems. Each solution is located in its respective folder and is named according to the LeetCode problem number and title.

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-solutions.git
